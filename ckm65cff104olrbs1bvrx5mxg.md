## How to Build a Guessing Number Game Using Python

Welcome to [Python Projects for Beginners Series](https://hashnode.com/series/python-projects-for-beginners-ckk31d9370h0vrus1blfl0a4y)🙋🏻‍♂️

I'm [Sai Ashish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-ashish/) and today, we are going to build a simple Guessing Number Game using Python. You will be given 3 chances. All you have to do is guess a number between 1 to 10 (included) and if you guess the number correctly, you win 🏆

Simple enough? Let's get started?🚀

## Through this project, you're going to learn about:

```
1. The Random Module
2. Basic concepts of Python: type casting, conditional statements,
   iterative statements and string interpolation
3. Implementation of the guessing the number game with detailed explanation
```

You can access the basic Python concepts required for this build from  [here](https://github.com/SaiAshish-Konchada/Python-Projects-for-Beginners/tree/main/Guess%20the%20number%20game)💣 

## Step 1: Modules Required:

To help us build this game, we are going to use an amazing module of Python called **Random.** The random module generates random numbers for us. This gets in real handy as we do not want our computer to be biased.

## Step 2: Time to Code!

The first step is to import the random module:

```
import random
```

Now, we want the computer to choose a random number between 1 and 10. To set these limits, we make use of the randint() method of python.


**Syntax of randint() is given as: **

```randint(lower limit , upper limit)```
 
**For Our Case:**

```
number = random.randint(1,10)
``` 
Let's give the player 3 chances to guess the lucky number. To do that, we would require a loop that would repeat our game 3 times. 

```
for i in range(0,3):
```

Inside our loop, we would like to ask the player for a number using the input() function. As python accepts string by default, we would convert the string into a number using function int(). The conversion of one data type into another is known as type casting or type conversion.
```
user = int(input("Guess the lucky number"))
```
Next, we would compare if the number guessed by the user equals the number generated by the computer. To compare, we use the 'if' statement and check for equality using the == operator.
```
if user == number:
```
If the number guessed is correct, we display "Hurray!!" using the print statement. 
```
print("Hurray!!")
```

We would also like to display the lucky number. We would implement this concept using a mechanism called f-string or literal string interpolation. 

Interpolation or interpolate means insert (something of a different nature) into something else. Here, we insert the value of the variables inside the statement of the string we are going to display.

```
#syntax for f-string or string interpolation
name = 'Ashish'
age = 20
print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old."

#output is generated as the value of variable replaced with contents of {}
Hello, My name is Ashish and I'm 20 years old.
```
In our game, we use interpolation as:
```
print(f"You guessed the number right, it's {number}")
```
Now, if the player has 3 unsuccessful attempts, the game gets over and the number is displayed on the screen as:

```
if user != number:
    print(f"Your guess is incorrect, the number is {number}"
```
