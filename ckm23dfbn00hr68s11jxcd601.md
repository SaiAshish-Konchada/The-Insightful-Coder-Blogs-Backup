2. Basics of Python: Functions
```

## Project 1: Notification Generator üî¢

As the name suggests, a notification generator generates a notification(a message) about a particular task, reminder or anything you require. In today's build, we would be generating a pop-up notification on a Windows device.

Apart from the obvious, you can integrate this snippet of code into any of your applications. For example, in  [How to Build an Alarm Clock using Python](https://theinsightfulcoder.com/how-to-build-an-alarm-clock-using-python), you can also generate a notification along with your favourite song. Or suppose you wanted to get an alert whenever your battery percentage is below 35 or get reminders, this is the tool for you.

### Let's Have a Look at Our Build:

![Notification Generator Using Python](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1615287211039/1noLX5aTw.png)

### Module Used:

For this build, we require the win10toast module. win10toast is an easy-to-use Python library for displaying Windows 10 Toast(Pop-up) Notifications. The official document of the module can be accessed from [here](https://pypi.org/project/win10toast/). 

To install the win10toast module, go to the terminal and run,

```
pip install win10toast
```
That's it. You're all ready for the build now. 

### Time to Code!

The first step is to import the win10toast module into our programming environment. For this, we use the import statement as,

```
from win10toast import ToastNotifier
```

Next, we define a function named windows_popup that takes three parameters as input ‚Äî title, content and duration. 

```
def windows_popup(title,content,duration=10):
```

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. Moreover,  it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.

In our function, we code two statements,

```
toast=ToastNotifier()
toast.show_toast(title,content,duration=duration)
```

We create an instance of the ToastNotifier class and store it inside toast variable. Imagine the instance as a remote control to your program. You can now use any buttons on the remote control to perform the task needed.

We call the show_toast function and pass the input parameters as seen. 

**Parameters:**

**title:** the title of the notification. it appears in bold. Example: Reminder <br>
**content:** the content of the notification. Example: Close down your desktop and go for a walk!<br>
**duration:** the duration in seconds you want the notification to be shown on the screen<br>

Finally, we call the function as:

```
windows_popup("Reminder", "Go and get a life!")
```

You can directly download the source code for Notification Generator from my [Github Respository](https://github.com/SaiAshish-Konchada/Python-Projects-for-Beginners/blob/main/5%20Python%20Projects%20in%205%20mins/Windows%20Notification.py).

## Project 2: Check Your Battery Percentage üîã

In this build, we generate the battery percentage of our device. 

### Module Used:

For this build, we use the psutil module. psutil is a cross-platform library for process and system monitoring in Python. The official documentation of the psutil module can be found  [here](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/).

To install psutil into our system, type in the terminal the following:

``` 
pip install psutil
```
### Time to Code!

As always, import the psutil module into our environment.

```
import psutil
```

Gain the remote control by creating an instance of the sensors_battery() class in the psutil module.

```
battery = psutil.sensors_battery()
```

Gain the battery percentage information into variable percent as follows:

```
percent = str(battery.percent)
```

To display the battery percent on the screen, type:

```
print("Battery Percent= " + percent + "%")
```

To **test** your coding skills, **try generating a notification when the battery percentage falls below 35%**. Comment your code in the comment box below!  

## Project 3: Take a Screenshot üñº

### Modules Required:

For this build, we require the Pyautogui and the time module.

PyAutoGUI is a python module that lets you control your mouse and keyboard using a program. PyAutoGUI also lets you automate your everyday tasks and can play games, login into emails, and more. You can access the official documentation of Pyautogui module from  [here.](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

To install PyAutoGUI in your system, open your terminal and run:

```
pip install pyautogui
```
The time module provides various time-related functions. We use it to retrieve the system time and display it on the screen. You can access the official documentation from [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) 

### Time to Code!

Importing the required modules into our python environment:

```
import pyautogui
import time
```
We use the time.sleep method to switch the application from our python environment to the screen we want to take a screenshot from. 

```
time.sleep(3)
```

To take the screenshot, we use pyautogui's screenshot method and store it inside the img variable.

```
img = pyautogui.screenshot()
```
To save the image, we use the save method as:

```
img.save(r"image.png")
```
**Note:** This command will save the image into the same directory as the location of the python file you're running from. 

### Final Source Code for Screenshot Taker is as follows:

## Project 4: Figlet Generator üî†

The Figlet Generator Converts ordinary text into a creative figure letter design(ASCII Art Font) as shown below:

![Figlet output image](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1615295031876/IlBNhjXYS.png)

### Modules Required:

For this build, we require the PyFiglet module. You can access the official documentation of Pyfiglet module from  [here](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7.4/).  The PyFiglet module can be installed by using: 

```
pip install pyfiglet
```
### Time to Code!

The first step is to import the Pyfiglet module

```
import pyfiglet 
```  

To convert your word into ASCII Block Art format we use the figlet_format function. We store the result into a variable called result. For slant font, we set the font to slant. For a normal block, just omit that parameter and enter only the text in double-quotes.

```
result = pyfiglet.figlet_format("Sai Ashish", font = "slant")
```

Display your creativity using the print statement:
```
print(result) 
```

## Project 5: Convert Text to Speech üó£

Last but not the last and my most favourite build among all, the Text to Speech Generator. 

### Module Required:

For this amazing build, we require the pyttsx3 module. pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.You can check the official documentation from  [here](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) 

To install pyttsx3 into our system, go to the terminal and type:

```
pip install pyttsx3
```

### Time to Code!

We import the pyttsx3 module into our environment using:

```
import pyttsx3
```

To get the remote control, we initialise pyttsx3 as:

```
engine = pyttsx3.init()
```

After gaining the instance, we use the say method to tell the engine to speak the sentence provided to it.
 
```
engine.say("Hello Everyone")
```

Finally, we use the runAndWait command to run the command.

```
engine.runAndWait()
```
