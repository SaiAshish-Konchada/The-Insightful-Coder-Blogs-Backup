## Top 10 Extensions You Must Use For Your Privacy

On this note, I warmly welcome you'll to the  [Tech-Hacks For Everybody Series](https://hashnode.com/series/tech-hacks-for-everybody-ckk3juqc10ihoqps16q0geabj) üõ† I'm [Sai Ashish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-ashish/), and in this article, we are going to explore the top 10 extensions I use to enhance my browsing experience and be aware of trackers and harmful scripts that break into my sanity.

## 1. HTTPS Everywhere

![HTTPS Everywhere Extension Logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611825400883/Xu21PsvHk.png)

HTTPS Everywhere is an extension created by EFF and the Tor Project, which automatically switches thousands of sites from insecure "http" to secure "https."  It protects you against forms of surveillance, account hijacking, and censorship.

You can get it at  [HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)  &  [HTTPS Everywhere for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp) .

## 2. NoScript

![NoScript Extension Logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611825766315/JWpy002eB.png)

No Script is the Winner of the "PC World Class Award" and bundled with the Tor Browser, giving you the best available protection on the web.

It allows JavaScript, Flash, Java, and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g., your home-banking site, mitigating remotely exploitable vulnerabilities, including Spectre and Meltdown.

It protects your "trust boundaries" against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), cross-zone DNS rebinding / CSRF attacks (router hacking), and Clickjacking attempts.

You can get it at  [NoScript for Firefox ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) &  [NoScript for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm?hl=en) .

## 3. Privacy Badger

![Privacy Badger Extension Logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611825870357/xgZ9cKC9J.png)

Privacy Badger automatically learns to block invisible trackers.

Instead of keeping lists of what to block, Privacy Badger automatically discovers trackers based on their behavior. Privacy Badger sends the Global Privacy Control signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the Do Not Track signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore your wishes, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.

Besides automatic tracker blocking, Privacy Badger replaces potentially useful trackers (video players, comments widgets, etc.) with click-to-activate placeholders and removes outgoing link click tracking on Facebook and Google, with more privacy protections on the way.

You can get it at  [Privacy Badger for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/)  &  [Privacy Badger for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) .
